## :The Project
This educational project is a simple implementation of well know framework in the market, Spring. I built a simple API that can make CRUD operations with two common entities - Persons and their addresses.<br>
I also used JPA Hibernate to map the objects and their relationships for the database is this application.

## :Future Implementations
One of the future implementations that I want to do is migrate the database, currently H2, to PostgresSQL. <br>
I also want to learn a Frontend framework, such as React, in order to build an interactive interface for final users.

## :Project Status
On going.
